This planner allows you to schedule out your work day. At the top you will see the current day and below you see block of times for standard business hours. The planner allows you to write in your tasks/events for each hour and clicking on the save buttons stores them in your local storage. Each text area is color coded. Green represents the future, red represtents the past, and gray represents the past.
